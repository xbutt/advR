# advR package

This package offers robust functionality for importing NetCDF files and generating IDF models based on user-defined parameters. The package provides both graphical and numerical representations of the IDF models, allowing for comprehensive analysis and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xbutt/advR")

```

## Usage

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(advR)
```

Example usage:
```{r}
sample_data <- process_nc(directory = "./data", pattern = ".nc", cell_ids = c(327, 328, 329))
result <- idf(sample_data)
print(result$data)
print(result$plot)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
